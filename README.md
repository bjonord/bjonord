### Hej! ðŸ‘‹

BjÃ¶rn Nordstrand that's me - Software Engineer and Infrastructure-/Cloud-nerd from southern Sweden.

Curiosity may have killed the cat, but it has served me well so far in life. Iâ€™m naturally inquisitive and bring a problem-solving perspective to work situations. I actively promote an environment for question asking and idea exploration. Determination and commitment are core to my character, but that doesnâ€™t keep me from embracing new challenges and easily adapting to new ways of working.
My desire to learn fuels me both professionally and personally.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Scala after having taken two of Martin Oderskys courses on coursera a few years ago I'm picking it up again.
