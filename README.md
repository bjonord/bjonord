### Hej! 👋

Björn Nordstrand that's me - Software Engineer and Infrastructure-/Cloud-nerd from southern Sweden.

Curiosity may have killed the cat, but it has served me well so far in life. I’m naturally inquisitive and bring a problem-solving perspective to work situations. I actively promote an environment for question asking and idea exploration. Determination and commitment are core to my character, but that doesn’t keep me from embracing new challenges and easily adapting to new ways of working.
My desire to learn fuels me both professionally and personally.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning Rust, this came about by circumstance following choices made for a project at work.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Buying a house has made me into a pretty decent rough carpenter.
